These are the data files shell scripts used to prepare the whitelist of ingredients for which to compute a density.

Notes:
- `density-candidates.txt` is created with a Makefile target
- `density-whitelist.txt` requires manual human processing and cannot be created automatically. Take good care of it. All other files can be created automatically.
